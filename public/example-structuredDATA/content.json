        "chapter_test": "High-Tech, Craft Revival and ergonomic I n October 1973, members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) issued an oil embargo in response to the US government's decision to resupply the Israeli military during the Yorn Kippur War, and as a result oil prices quadrupled. Drastically higher oil prices of course made plastic - the favourite material of the previous decade - much more expensive, and beyond that, all manufacturers felt the pressure of higher energy, transportation and production costs. Most were forced to slash their research and development budgets, spelling an end to Pop and unfettered experimentation in product design. As home and export markets contracted and costs soared, conservative, low-risk design became the norm. In furniture design, for instance, bright plastics fell out of favour and were replaced by wood, steel and glass. The pervasive conservatism in mainstream design during the mid to late seventies felt, in many ways, like a return to Modernism. In fact, in these years there was a general re-evaluation on the part of the design cognoscenti of the Modern Movement's achievements, and Modernist design icons such as Marcel Breuer's Wassily chair and Le Corbusier's chaise longue became an increasingly common feature of interiors. This same back-to-basics mindset also prompted a rather uninspiring form of seventies rationalism, which was typified by the use of geometric forms and muted earthy tones, all of which were in stark contrast to the exuberant colours and sculptural forms of pre-crisis design. Indeed, within the car industry as well as in the furniture market, most designs looked as though they had been created using a setsquare, and the truth of the matter was that they probably had been. Certainly within automotive design there was an increasing emphasis on masculine boxy forms, which continued well into the mid-198os. Another effect of the oil crisis was to prompt American car manufacturers to explore more fuel-efficient \"compact\" models, although Japanese car manufacturers, who had already positioned themselves in this market with models such as the Toyota Corolla and the Datsun Sunny (both 1966), went on to dominate it, both of those cars selling in impressive numbers around the world. This rationalism in international design also found expression in the industrial-chic aesthetic of the new High-Tech style. The first stirrings of this style had actually occurred in architecture during the late 1960s, when British architects such as Richard Rogers and Norman Foster were inspired by the problem-solving approach of the design-engineer and futurist philosopher Richard Buckminster Fuller - a relationship of which Foster later noted: \"I was privileged to collaborate with Bucky for the last 12 years of his life and this had a profound influence on my own work and thinking. Inevitably, I also gained an insight into his philosophy and achievements.\" 1 In 1968 Buckminster Fuller had published a book, Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, that in addition to popularizing the term \"spaceship earth\" raised awareness about the finite nature of fossil fuels. As an early environmentalist, he had also argued that design could be used more mindfully, to create more eco-efficient solutions. But he was no Luddite: rather, he advocated doing more with less - a classically Modernist ethos that chimed with the financially straitened times brought about by the Oil Crisis. As Rogers, Foster and another British architect, Michael Hopkins, incorporated unadorned industrial elements such as exposed steel beams, pipework and vent shafts into their High-Tech buildings, the style began to find its way into mainstream interior design. Starkly utilitarian equipment and fittings manufactured for use in factories and institutions, such as metal trolleys, rubber flooring, clamp lighting, Metro's Super Erecta shelving units and Kee Klamp scaffolding poles, all featured in these interiors, which often used bold primary colour schemes in homage to the earlier De Stijl movement. These industrial furnishing elements had the added benefit of being relatively inexpensive, having been created for high-volume, contract usage, and this had a certain appeal in the midst of a recession. As well as \"found\" elements, the High-Tech interior also frequently featured Rodney Kinsman's Omkstak chair (1971), which became an icon of the age. Also popular in seventies interiors was Collier-Campbell's Bauhaus textile for Liberty, which reflected the renewed interest in designs from the Modern Movement, being itself a colourful reinterpretation of a Bauhaus tapestry. Around this time there was also an increasing ethical awareness about the role of design in society. This was expressed in the democratic work of the Swedish design duo Johan Huldt and Jan Dranger, who established their own manufacturing company, Innovator Design, to produce and market their designs anonymously in order to counter the cult of designer products. Using tubular metal, sheets of perforated metal and canvas, Huldt and Dranger developed a range of colourful, inexpensive and highly practical furnishings - including chairs, tables, trolleys and shelving- that exemplified Swedish design's egalitarianism and also signalled a new internationalism in Scandinavian design. Innovator's products were hugely successful throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, and were even retailed by the likes of Habitat and IKEA. While the roots ofHuldt and Dranger's furniture can be found in 1930s Swedish Functionalism, these designs were also quintessentially of the High-Tech school. The style also found fertile ground in the United States, where the well-known interior designers Joseph Paul D'Urso and Ward Bennett incorporated salvaged industrial materials into their interior schemes. In 1978 Joan Kron and Suzanne Slesin published a book on the design phenomenon, entitled High-Tech: The Industrial Style and Source Book for the Home, though already by this stage the style was on the wane. Rather than dying out completely, though, it morphed into the short-lived Matte Black style of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which was distinguished by a macho, modernistic aesthetic, as presaged by Richard Sapper's Tizio task light (1972) or seen in the very earliest work of Philippe Starck, such as his Mac Gee bookshelf (1979). Like its older brother High-Tech, Matte Black was uncompromisingly industrial. Paradoxically, while High-Tech was enjoying its brief starring role in international design, there was also a major return to craft-design during the 1970s. The Craft Revival, as it came to be known, was not only the antithesis of the High-Tech style, but also ran counter to the overt consumerism of the previous two decades. Craft revivalists such as John Makepeace in Britain and Wendell Castle in the United States attempted to preserve the craft traditions in wood, which had suffered so much from the dominance of industrial production - though like that of their spiritual predecessor William Morris, their work was time-consuming to produce and so necessarily expensive. One of the main reasons for the flourishing of the Craft Revival was reduced employment in the design industry as a whole - as companies' research and development budgets contracted, so did the number of jobs for professional designers. Even those designers that did find work found that the conservative mood of the recession left little room for creative engagement. As a result, during the 1970s many designers were effectively excluded from industry, by lack of employment or lack of inclination, and many such individuals embraced the polar opposite of the industrial process: handicraft. With virtually no financial outlay other than the cost of raw materials, and an appealingly low-tech, do-it-yourself ethos, the Craft Revival enabled design practitioners to re-engage with the hands-on process of making, and to make that process a form of personal creative expression. The movement also reflected a growing eco-awareness, which had first emerged in the previous decade: the environmental impact of individual designer-craftsmen making bespoke objects is, of course, far less than that of industrial manufacturing systems. Perhaps the greatest driver of the Craft Revival, though, was its power to foster emotional connections between objects and users - something that was sorely lacking in the disposable design gimmickry of the 1960s and the sterile industrial production of the 1970s mainstream. The social mission of design, as expounded by Victor Papanek in his book Design for the Real World (1970), also became a theme of the mid to late 1970s, most notably in the increasing use of ergonomics in design practice, with the goal of creating better-performing, safer and more user-friendly products. This was especially the case for equipment destined for the work environment, and one of the main drivers for this was President Richard Nixon's establishment in 1970 of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the mission of which was to \"assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance\". 2 Other countries were also establishing public bodies to oversee the introduction of health and safety standards around this time, and companies were coming to realize that better-designed workplaces could lead to increased efficiency and productivity. One of the pioneers in this field was the American industrial designer Niels Diffrient, who while working in the offices of Henry Dreyfuss co-authored the Humanscale 1/2/3 manual (1974), which became the industrial designer's bible of ergonomic data. 3 This portfolio of human factors information contained three double-sided plastic reference tables printed with data relating to the sizes of people, seating considerations, and requirements for the elderly and disabled. The calculation guides also had measurement wheels that could be turned to give precise information on, for instance, the optimum height for lumbar supports, armrests, tabletops, and so forth, which were determined by the height of the theoretical user. This more scientific understanding of the human form helped designers to create products that worked in better harmony with and were more comfortable for users. Emilio Ambasz's Vertebra chair (1977), for instance, was one of the first office chairs to be designed from an ergonomic standpoint, and the first to respond automatically to the user's movement, thereby maintaining continuous contact and support. Another early ergonomic office chair was Fred Scott's Supporto, manufactured by Hille, which managed to combine comfort based on science with stylish, combination. Scandinavian designers made some notable contributions to healthy seating design, too, among them the Norwegian Peter Opsvik, who developed the first ergonomic sitting tool, the Balans Variable chair (1979) for Stokke, and the Finnish Yrjo Kukkapuro, whose Fysio office chair (1978) had a distinctive high back that followed the contours of the user's spine. Ergonomic design clearly had roots in social ideas related to health and inclusivity, but it was also a manifestation of the wider return to Rationalism High-Tech, Crah Revival and ergonomics in design. Trimmed of all decoration, these items were pure expressions of function, shaped by data rather than creative intuition. The only drawback was that, for all their enhanced performance, they were rarely what might be considered visually exciting. Radical Design re-emerge Mainstream design of the mid- to late seventies was, on the whole, rather dull, even in Italy: manufacturers produced bland products and consumers bought them. Yet fermenting under the surface was the Italian Radical Design movement, which had emerged during the late 1960s and now had a lot more to rail against, in the midst of such banality in mass-produced objects. The architect, designer and artist Riccardo Dalisi had already undertaken experiments with tecnologia povera (poor technology) in the late 1960s, and had later organized workshops for underprivileged children in the Traiano district of Naples in 1973, in an attempt to bring personal and spontaneous creativity back to design practice. His research inspired the establishment of a \"school\" of counter-architecture and counter-design in the editorial offices of Casabella magazine in Milan in January 1973. This new venture, known as Global Tools, was founded by a roster of Italy's most avantgarde design practitioners: Archizoom Associati, Remo Buti, Riccardo Dalisi, Ugo La Pietra, Gruppo 9999, Gaetano Pesce, Gianni Pettena, Ettore Sottsass, Superstudio, Gruppo UFO and Zziggurat. In the magazine's March 1973 issue the group defined itself as \"a system of workshops for the propagation of the use of natural materials, and the relevant behaviours\", and explained that its objective was \"to stimulate the free development of individual creativity\". 4 Armed with a do-it-yourself ethos and a left-leaning political agenda, Global Tools sought to creatively connect ordinary people with the design process. For the two years of its brief operation it was the central forum of Radical Design and the project's disbandment in 1975 signified the end of Radical Design's first phase in Italy. Despite the eventual break-up of Global Tools, new mutating shoots of Radical Design had appeared a year earlier when the designer Alessandro Mendini set fire to two identical archetypal chairs outside the offices of Casabella, where he was editor-in-chief. Both chairs bore the name Lassu (Up There), and the act of burning them was intended to blur the boundaries between art and design. This incendiary act was followed by another symbolic chair burning later that same year, in which another Lassu chair was taken to a quarry and placed on a flight of steps before being engulfed in flames and photographed. This now legendary act of destruction was intended to enact the legend of the phoenix, allowing new designs to rise from the ashes of old; by symbolically placing an idealized object within the context oflife and death, Mendini had attempted to provide it with a more human dimension. Two years later, in 1976, the architect Alessandro Guerriero founded Studio Alchimia, which would become the main champion of this provocative new form of intellectually challenging counter-design, best described as the second phase of Radical Design. Although first intended as a gallery space in which to exhibit work that was not constrained by industrial mass production, Studio Alchimia soon became an influential design studio that produced avant-garde work by designers including Ettore Sottsass, Alessandro Mendini, Andrea Branzi, Paola Navone and Michele De Lucchi. The studio's name, which alluded to chemistry's pseudo-scientific predecessor, was a jibe at the scientific rationale underlying Modernism. It also referenced alchemy's association with magical transmutation, and the transformation of existing designs became a defining feature of the studio's work. The best-known examples of this approach were Alessandro Mendini's redesigns of iconic furniture pieces: he decorated Marcel Breuer's Wassily chair with colourful, organic forms reminiscent of camouflage; gave Joe Colombo's Universale chair a faux-marble finish; and attached ensigns to Gio Ponti's Superleggera chair in reference to the traditional fisherman's chair that had inspired it. More famous, though, was Mendini's Proust Armchair (1978), which was an act of\"banal design\", whereby an everyday object was transformed into an ironic design statement with the addition of innovative colours and/or applied motifs: in this case, an antiquestyle armchair was decorated in a pointillist style, with multicoloured dabs of paint. Studio Alchimia's ironically named Bau.Haus 1 and Bau.Haus 2 collections, ofi978 and 1979 respectively, pointedly ridiculed what these designers saw as the banality of the prevailing Modernist aesthetic. Andrea Branzi explained Studio Alchimia's central - and rather pessimistic - premise by stating that \"operations of redesign consisted of touching up found objects or famous products of design to illustrate the impossibility of designing something new in respect to what has already been designed\". 5 Highly semantic and self-consciously elitist, intellectual and politicized, Studio Alchimia's facetious, subversive work, and that of the second wave of Radical Design from which it came, laid the foundations of the Memphis Design Group. Radical culture was also stirring in Britain, where the deep recession of the 1970s and the high unemployment rates that came with it produced a disenfranchised generation that was deeply sceptical of the establishment. Punk was the natural expression of this disaffection, emerging in fashion and music in around 1974 and soon making the leap to graphic and product design, in, for example, Jamie Reid's anarchic 1977 cover for the Sex Pistols' \"God Save the Queen\" and, slightly later, Daniel Weil's Radio-in-a-Bag (1981). British interior design, at the time typified by Habitat and its by-then phenomenally successful flat-pack furniture, fluffy duvets and chicken bricks, also felt the effects of punk, in the anarchic Creative Salvage movement it spawned in around 1981. The electronics age While mainstream design was, for the most part, not as \"happening\" in the 1970s as it had been in the previous decade, there was one notable exception: consumer electronics. In fact, it could be said that the decade saw a revolution in this manufacturing sector, with Sony launching its first videocassette recorder, or VCR, in 1971, and the Dutch electronics company Philips introducing a competing model the following year. A battle of videotape formats later raged between JVC's VHS and Sony's Betamax from the mid 1970s into the '8os, with the former famously emerging as the victor. Whichever side they chose, during this period consumers were able, for the first time, to record television programmes and watch them at their own convenience. They could also buy or rent videos meaning their homes had become far more entertaining as movies could now be viewed at their convenience. The videocassette recorder though technically very primitive in comparison to today's electronic gadgets and streaming capabilities was an important first step towards the desigp of more personalized entertainment-delivery systems. The year after the VCR was introduced saw - as any gaming enthusiast will know- the launch of the world's first really successful arcade video game, Pong. Designed by the American games developer Atari, this simple game opened the floodgates to a whole new area of design endeavour and birthed an industry that would eventually come to rival the older entertainment markets of film and television. Less well known is that 1972 was also the release year of the world's first video-game console for the home, the Magnavox Odyssey. The American inventor and engineer Ralph Baer, now widely regarded as the father of video games, was behind this new family of home electronics products; prototypes had been developed in the late 1960s, and the final working prototype, produced in 1968, was known as the \"Brown Box\". Magnavox first publicly demonstrated the Odyssey in May 1972 and released it in August of that year, predating Atari's Pong home console by three years. (And as a footnote in gaming history, it should be noted that Pong's classic ping-pong game was actually inspired by the Odyssey's earlier table-tennis game.) The gaming industry really came of age, though, with the Atari 2600, which was released in 1977 and was the first console, which rather than being programmed with a set number of games, could instead be used to play an unlimited number of games cartridges, thus offering far greater gaming choice. The following year brought the much 0 played Space Invaders arcade game, and with it a new sophistication in gaming design; when it was released for use at home in 1980 it sent sales of the Atari 2600 console rocketing and cemented home gaming as an established and lucrative market. The development of video games did not stop with the console, but involved the design of the games, too, and, along with other types of software programming, this considerably widened the scope of design practice. Traditionally, designers had created objects; now they also operated in-the digital realm, and were also pioneering the design of interfaces that connected the real and the virtual. In the early 1970s Motorola began to experiment with cellular radio technology, and the results of those tests went on to revolutionize communication devices. In 1973 the company trialled the world's first \"portable radio phone\" in New York. It was a hefty device, though still mobile, known as the DynaTAC. The model was refined and, after gaining approval from the Federal Communications Commission, went on sale a decade later, in 1983. For obvious reasons, it quickly gained the nickname \"the brick\". Mobile phones were unsuitable for consumer use until after 1978, when the first automated cellular networks were launched, so it was not until the 1980s that the world went really mobile. The Sony Walkman was also developed in the late 1970s, and the first model, the TPS-L2, was released in 1979, though it did not achieve iconic status until the 1980s. It was to become a key lifestyle product of that decade, despite its rapid battery drainage and limitation to the single function of playing a music cassette. The mobile phone and the Walkman were revolutionary in their unprecedented miniaturization of technology and introduced two brand-new types of personalized, mobile electronic product to the market. This area of design was soon to have a transformative effect on society and would, of course, eventually functionally converge into a single device."

        "chapter_test": "Memphis and Postmodernism The 1980s was a highly significant decade in the story of design, in which the new international avant-garde style, Postmodernism, boosted the profile of the discipline exponentially, and digital tools emerged that would increasingly come to shape it. After the economic woes of the angst-ridden 1970s, it seemed as though a page had been turned to a new chapter of history, giving innovative design an opportunity to flourish once again. A resurgence in right-wing political thinking - as espoused by Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, and her American presidential counterpart, Ronald Reagan - and the changes this brought in its wake, from the privatization of nationalized companies, to the breaking of the unions' grip on industrial production, to the loosening of financial market regulations, saw the global economy finally pull itself out of recession and begin to surge upwardly. The go-getting culture of the day brought with it an increase in home-ownership and widespread dabbling on the stock market, as well as a renewed feeling of optimism among many people, who felt that a free-market economy would lead to a better future. The paternalism that had so shaped governments'. economic policies in the West from the late 1930s to the late 1970s, as advocated by the British economist John Maynard Keynes, had been replaced by a very different doctrine that was radically opposed to interventionist \"Big Government\". The new economic mood was inspired by the American economist Milton Friedman's argument that the well-meaning interventionist policies of the Federal Reserve during the Great Depression had actually made matters worse, and that a laissez-faire approach might have worked much better in lifting America out of its financial malaise. With the world still in the grip of a protracted economic downturn during the late 1970s and early 1980s, both Reagan and Thatcher seized upon Friedman's ideas, believing that the society of free enterprise and lower taxation, less regulation and restrained public spending that he advocated might be just what was needed to start the economy's cogs turning once again. This message focused on the power of individuals, rather than government or society, to effect change - an empowering theme for young entrepreneurs. The ideas of freedom from intervention and self-motivation espoused during this period lie at the very heart of the American Dream, and in Britain as in America at this time the message was that hard work, ability and persistence would be rewarded with social mobility. So how did this mindset alter design practice? The most notable effect was the more entrepreneurial streak that became increasingly apparent in designers and design companies; another was that there was far more disposable income floating around for the acquisition of\"design\", which became a subject of increasing public interest, academic study and debate. After the relative stasis of design practice in the mid to late 1970s, during which the Italian Radical Design movement, innovative though it was, remained a minority interest, there was a sudden surge of change as a new wave of avant-garde design broke on the international design scene in the early 1980s. Such was its effect that the 1980s came to be known as \"the designer decade\" - although for the vast majority of people \"design\" still meant \"designer labels\", and the term was generally used for fashion items such as jeans, sunglasses, trainers and even underwear; some other fashionable lifestyle accessories were also given this appellation, among them Zippo lighters, Dualit toasters, Bang & Olufsen stereos and Rolex watches. It was not until the 1990s that the general public was reminded that \"design\" was not just a noun but also a verb - that it is a process of problem-solving. The origins of what was then termed New Wave design, but which also became known as Postmodernism, can be traced to December 1980, when Ettore Sottsass hosted an informal gathering of designers at his apartment on Milan's Via San Galdino - an event that would be woven into contemporary design lore. At 64 years old, Sottsass had already achieved considerable success in industrial design and was an acknowledged leader of the Italian Radical Design movement, but he had no plans to slow down. He invited a number of talented designers, all in their 20s, to discuss his plan to produce a new line of furniture to be executed by his old friend Renzo Brugola, who owned a cabinetmaking workshop in Milan. Even in the early 1980s, the craft skills that had been such an important factor in the economic miracle in post-war Italy were still very much in existence, and Sottsass had realized that they offered a means of creating innovative design outside of mainstream industrial production. Although he had collaborated with Studio Alchimia and contributed his Svincolo floor lamp, among other designs, to its first collection, he found the group's focus on redesign and \"banal design\" too pessimistic and creatively restrictive. Sottsass had a vision of something far more attuned to the emerging optimism of the 1980s: a sort ofneo-Pop that was visually loud and colourful but which, like the work of Studio Alchimia, was infused with layers of symbolism. While the design guru discussed with his youthful acolytes - Martine Bedin, Aldo Cibic, Michele De Lucchi, Matteo Thun and Marco Zanini - his idea for a furniture range that he dubbed \"The New Design\", in the background Bob Dylan's song Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again played on the record player, repeatedly getting stuck on the words \"Memphis blues again\". The design writer Barbara Radice, who was present at this rather drunken meeting, recalled that after much discussion about the name of this new furn\\ture collection, \"Sottsass said: 'Okay, let's call it Memphis,' and everyone thought it was a great name: Blues, Tennessee, rock'n'roll, American suburbs, and then Egypt, the Pharaohs' capital, the holy city of the god Ptah.\" 1 Memphis certainly had the layered meanings Sottsass aspired to, being both the name of the ancient Egyptian capital of culture and that of the Tennessee birthplace of Elvis Presley. It was the perfect moniker for a design collective that relished drawing eclectic inspiration from cultures near and far, high and low. Although no prescriptive directions were given about form, function, materials, style and so on - that approach being too much like Modernism, with all its rigid rules - the designs created for the collection had a distinct aesthetic that reflected this taste for sampling and mixing styles from the past and the present in order to create something completely new. This intentionally mischievous practice reflected a more energetic and international outlook in design; designers were now also far more self-aware, on the whole, being by this stage well and truly versed in semiotics, the study of language and symbols. Roland Barthes's Mythologies (first published in 1957) had brought an understanding of the subject to the field of design, and this was deepened by Umberto Eco's more recent publication, A Theory of Semiotics (1976). While Studio Alchimia had sought (and was still seeking) to intellectualize design by introducing semantic meanings, Memphis was far more playful in its use of coded meanings and mixed messages. Above all else, this design collective celebrated the cultural pluralism of Postmodernism, and to this end created designs that used eye-catching colour combinations, bold totemic forms and plastic laminates with New Wave style geometric and biomorphic patterning. This was Postmodern design at its loudest and most attention-seeking, and Memphis made a startling impact with its provocative de but at the Milan Furniture Fair (Salone de! Mobile) in 1981. It was a riotous design circus, and the enigmatic Ettore Sottsass took the role of ringmaster to the youthful band of design renegades, which included not only the designers that had been present at that legendary soiree but now also an assortment of foreign practitioners, notable among whom George Sowden, Nathalie Du Pasquier, Javier Mariscal and Masanori Umeda; over the coming years they would be joined by Hans Hollein, Shiro Kuramata, Peter Shire, Michael Graves and others. Being extremely media-savvy, Memphis did what no anti-design group had successfully done before: they popularized Postmodernist theory by repackaging it into, as the design critic Alice Rawsthorn puts it, \"a fun, seductive form that millions understood\". 2 The language of Postmodern design that they introduced was exuberantly playful, capturing the optimism emerging in the early 1980s as the world's economy started to heave itself out of recession. Memphis designs stood out in a sea of uninspiring furniture at the Salone de! Mobile and captivated the world's design press, which helped the group to disseminate their Postmodern message around the world. The diverse nationalities of Memphis members also ushered in a new era of internationalism in design, which would become a marked feature of design's evolution over the coming years. Memphis's multicultural picking and mixing of references also anticipated the increasing globalization that occurred in the 1980s, the decade in which not just mass travel but also mass emigration created cultures of ethnic diversity around the world, as so famously celebrated by the art director Oliviera Toscani in his \"United Colors\" campaign for Benetton during this period. In parallel, the shrinking of the world through the increasingly global reach of the media - catalyzed by the launches of CNN and MTV in 1980 and 1981 respectively -saw design communities in various parts of the world becoming increasingly aware of one anothers' work. This cross-pollination of ideas contributed to a growing understanding and acceptance of Postmodernism throughout the international design community. Following the huge impact ofMemphis's first show, the New Wave of Postmodernism became a truly international style. In America Postmodernism found expression in the tongue-in-cheek classicizing designs of Michael Graves, Charles Jencks and Robert Venturi, the playful \"California New Wave\" furnishings of Peter Shire and the quirky buildings and chairs of Frank Gehry; Michael Graves's bird-whistling kettle for Alessi became an icon of the brash new style. Alessi also helped the style to coalesce into an international design movement with its Tea & Coffee Piazza project, which got the leading avant-garde designers and architects of the day- including Italian designers such as Sottsass and Aldo Rossi as well as international names including Graves and Venturi - to design innovative silver tea and coffee services that had a distinctive architectonic Post-Modern flavour. The project ran from 1979 until 1983, and like Memphis, Alessi was able to rely on traditionally skilled craftsmen to execute the impressive body of work. These pieces transformed the humble tools of tea- and coffee-making into totemic symbols of the Postmodern style; Aldo Rossi's contribution was enclosed in a temple-like glass case complete with a classical pediment and jaunty little flag. These designs and those produced by Memphis might have relied on craft skills, but they did not have an overt craft aesthetic, possessing instead the type of precision finish generally associated with machine production - in other words, whereas at the beginning of the industrial revolution the machine was used to mimic handcraft, these designs relied on craftsmanship to create the illusion of machine production, rather like the early designs coming out of the Dessau Bauhaus that speculated on standardized mass production. This type of Postmodern design was less concerned with functional considerations than with design as a rhetorical statement. The huge PR success of Alessi's Tea & Coffee Piazza made the company more conscious of the nationalities of the designers it commissioned, as well as of the overseas markets that it began to pursue. Seeing that commissioning work from leading Postmodernist designers and architects was an efficient way of attracting publicity and raising one's avantgarde credentials with relatively little outlay, other established companies followed suit. The American furniture manufacturer Knoll produced a collection designed by Robert Venturi and his wife and partner Denise Scott Brown. With his famous quip that was a take on Mies van der Rohe, \"Less is a Bore\", Venturi was one of the earliest and most important proponents of Postmodernism; his seminal book Learningfrom Las Vegas: The Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form (1972), co-written with Scott Brown and Steven Izenour, had become required reading for architects and designers, not least for controversially lauding the garish cultural honesty of the Las Vegas Strip and exploring the idea of architecture as symbol. Putting theory into practice, the Venturi Collection (completed 1984) for Knoll comprised nine chairs, a sofa and various tables that irreverently referenced American and European furniture history. These simplifications of cliched furniture forms caricatured historic decorative styles, and in so doing called into question the intellectualized veneration that surrounded them. In Japan, too, there was a blossoming of Postmodernism, or as Ettore Sottsass had termed it the \"New International Style\", notably in the work of Shiro Kuramata, Arata Isozaki and Masanori Umeda - all of whom contributed designs to the Memphis collections - and ofToshiyuki Kita, who created the very Postmodern Wink sofa (1980) for Cassina. Kuramata, one of the most influential Japanese designers of the twentieth century, took Postmodernism to a new level of aesthetic refinement and poetic symbolism. His work suffused a Minimalist aesthetic with poetic emotion to create objects of rare and ethereal beauty; the Miss Blanche chair from 1988 might best exemplify his alchemical use of synthetic polymers to create otherworldly designs that bridged Eastern traditions and the emerging Postmodern design ethos. To understand Kuramata's work, one must appreciate the spatial tension he created between object and environment, in which his \"dematerialized\" designs often appeared to float lightly in a space. The Miss Blanche chair was named after Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, and Kuramata's use of falling red roses was inspired by a corsage worn by Vivien Leigh in the play's 1951 film adaptation. Like other creations by Kuramata, this evocative design had extraordinary sensory and spatial qualities, and demonstrated that an object could resonate with symbolism and poetry and transcend function altogether. Being produced as exclusive limited editions, rather like artworks, the work also transcended the divide between art and design. Thus Kuramata's work revealed, in a very Postmodern way, that the primary function of a specific design might have nothing to do with its physical requirements but might rather fulfil metaphysical ones. The Creative Salvage movement Another expression of Postmodernism that emerged in London during the early 1980s, and which was far more rough-and-ready than the beautifully crafted work produced by Memphis and Alessi and the ethereal designs of Shiro Kuramata, was the Creative Salvage movement. Like its kindred spirit Punk, Creative Salvage had an anarchic aesthetic and an anti-mainstream agenda. The origins of the movement go back to London's club scene in the early 1980s, when design-renegades Tom Dixon, Mark Brazier-Jones and Nick Jones would wow audiences with on-stage performance welding. This youthful group held their first show of design assemblages made from scrap in 1983. For this event they wrote a manifesto, which stated: We are convinced the way ahead does not lie in expensive, anonymous, mass-produced high-tech products but in a more decorative, human approach to industrial and interior design. The key to Creative Salvage's success is not in the expensive research and development costs of modern-day products, but in the recycling of scrap to form stylish and functional artifacts for the home and office.3 A year later a second sell-out Creative Salvage show was staged that also included the work of the French designer Andre Dubreuil. Liliane Fawcett, a London-based gallery owner, recalls, \"It was completely different. There was nothing that could compare to it, only punk fashion. The first feeling you had was that it was an impulse of energy. Everything else in London was kind of dreary in comparison.\" 4 Meanwhile, the architect Ron Arad had also begun to experiment with similar \"ready-made\" designs assembled from \"found\" objects, and in 1981 he established his own furniture making company, One Off with his business partner, Caroline Thorman. Two years later he opened a gallery-cum-studio in Covent Garden to show his own designs as well as work by other up-and-coming avant-garde creatives, such as the glass designer Danny Lane. One of Arad's earliest designs was his well-known Rover chair (1981), which ingeniously used an old Rover 200 car seat bought from a scrapyard, mounted on the Kee Klamp scaffolding elements that had been such a feature of High-Tech interiors. Meanwhile, his record player cast in concrete (1983) resoundingly expressed, as the Design Museum puts it, \"London's early 1980s spirit of rugged individualism and post-punk nihilism set against a backdrop of urban blight.\"5 As part of the wider Postmodern movement, Creative Salvage helped to revolutionize design in much the same way that Punk irrevocably changed music and fashion and it was significant to the subsequent development of avant-garde design because it helped to break down the traditional barriers between art, craft and design. As outsiders to the design establishment, the designers associated with the Creative Salvage movement championed both a new way of making design and a new raw aesthetic. Traditional textures, materials and functionality were all rejected in favour of rough metal, salvaged scrap and sculptural forms. As the 1980s progressed, though, the assemblages of Ron Arad and Tom Dixon became increasingly refined, and by the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s these two prodigiously talented designers were beginning to have their work produced by established manufacturing companies, notably the Well Tempered chair for Vitra Editions (1986) and the S chair (1988) for Cappellini, respectively. Their hands-on approach had given these young designers an understanding of materials and processes that would have a major bearing on their later, more mature work. A similarly raw, experimental, Postmodern approach was found in the work of the graphic designer and typographer Neville Brody, who was art director for The Face magazine from 1981 until 1986 and also created various album covers that epitomized New Wave graphics. The art director Terry Jones launched i-D magazine in 1980, and the cover he designed for its first issue, which turned the magazine's name into a pink-on-black emoticon, aligned the magazine with a do-it-yourself, Postmodern aesthetic that cheekily countered the slick perfection of mainstream graphic design. In America, a similar trashing of Modernism's typographic rules was found in the magazine layouts designed by David Carson for Transworld SKATEboarding magazine during the mid 1980s. This brash, liberated graphic style captured contemporary youth culture's creative vibrancy and ran roughshod over the staid aesthetic refinement of Modernism. Philippe Starck and designer hotels P ostmodernism also evolved and mutated into what is best described as the Late Modern style in France during the 1980s, with the work of Philippe Starck, who was not only a prodigious design talent but also a skilled showman. Starck understood the emotional pull of objects with character. His earliest designs, such as the Sarapis bar stool (1985), were in the Matte Black style - a short-lived neo-modernistic style of the early 1980s that had a hard-edged, masculine sensibility, 6 but his work soon became more playful and colourful in a Late Modern style that was characterized by the skilful reinterpretation of past styles or forms taken out of context. Starck ingeniously used the names of his designs to inject a sense of personality, as, for example, with his Doctor Sonderbar chair (1983) and his Lola Mundo chair (1988). Working with an array of manufacturers, including XO, Driade and Alessi, Starck worked his magic on all kinds of objects, from the humble toothbrush to - perhaps most famouslythe lemon squeezer, in 1990. He became the first real international design superstar and manufacturers were soon clamouring to collaborate with him, thanks to his commercial track record and high-profile name: the label \"Designed by Starck\" almost guaranteed commercial success, and even association with him raised a company's profile. Throughout this extraordinarily prolific period, Starck consistently created work that was functionally innovative and that frequently raised its Late Modern qualities to a poetic level. Starck was also largely responsible for popularizing another manifestation of design: the boutique hotel. These hotels were (and still are) theatrically contrived spaces intended to exude a sense of exclusive, \"designed\" luxury. The concept was the brainchild of Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell, the former of whom had already found success and notoriety as the impresario of New York's infamous Studio 54 nightclub in the late 1970s. Tapping into the emerging \"lifestyle\" market, the pair first commissioned the French designer Andree Putman to redesign Morgan's Hotel in Manhattan; this first \"design\" hotel offered a more intimate and atmospheric experience than the large chains or the stuffy, historic landmark hotels that every city boasts. It was, however, Philippe Starck's Royalton Hotel, established in 1988, that really popularized the phenomenon. This over-the-top Gesamtkunstwerk, skilfully fitted into an awkward long and narrow site, was a thoroughly Late Modern exercise in architectural space being designed as a dramatic stage for experience rather than around functional concerns. Described by the journalist Fred A. Bernstein as \"Philippe Starck's Miracle on 44th Street\",7 the Royalton boasted one of the iconic interior design schemes of the period and helped to popularize the idea of the designer lifestyle that was to become a potent theme the following decade. Although this hip hotel, with all its luxurious accoutrements, might have seemed very different to the previous decades' earnest efforts to promote Good Design, it was responsible for bringing the idea of design as lifestyle into the public consciousness. It also stimulated a design feeding frenzy during the 1990s, as people who had enjoyed the stylish delights of designer hotels - or who watched the surfeit of \"makeover\" interior design programmes then popular on television - strove to replicate the \"designer hotel look\" in their own homes. The computer design revolution and the rise of the brand Despite the opulence of the Royalton Hotel and similar new outfits, all was not well in the financial markets of the late 1980s. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had collapsed on Black Monday in October 1987, and though the economy seemed to rally at first thanks to continuing consumer spending fuelled by easy credit, these measures proved insufficient. By 1989 economic growth had stalled; a year later another spike in oil prices, among other factors, finally turned boom to bust. Although the financial contraction of the early 1990s only lasted about four years, there was a steep economic downturn that saw property markets collapse from London to Tokyo. And yet even while the markets crashed, a computer design revolution was taking place that would reinvigorate the economy and - more than that - transform society as it was known. The digital era had truly begun in 1984 with the release of the original Apple Macintosh desktop computer, conceived by a youthful Steve Jobs as a $500 computer. Despite eventually having a price tag about five times that amount, the Apple Mac was a game-changing machine that marked the real breakthrough in personal computing. Launched with the strapline \"Insanely great!\" and then cleverly marketed as \"the computer for the rest ofus\", 8 this beige-box design boasted a high-definition screen and easy-to-use mouse, and was the first affordable computer to have a graphical user interface (GUI) - allowing users to interact with it using images rather than text commands -which made it much easier to operate than previous models. The icons of the Mac's revolutionary graphical interface - the trashcan, the bomb, the smiling monitor and so on -were devised by one of the great unsung design heroes of the computer revolution, Susan Kare, who \"gave computing a human face\", in the words of the science reporter Steve Silberman. 9 With these icons Kare created skeuomorphic representations ofreal-world objects to make the commands familiar and easy to understand - a huge breakthrough given that earlier computers had used deeply off-putting command lines, expecting users to insert text instructions. Kare was also one of the pioneers of digital fonts, notably creating some of the original Macintosh \"city\" fonts such as Athens, New York, Monaco, San Francisco, Geneva and Cairo. The personal computer also began to replace designers' and engineer's centuries-old traditional drafting and modelling with two-dimensional, vector- based drafting systems and three-dimensional solidand surface-modelling software programs. Although Computer-Aided Design (CAD) was first developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1950s, in that era of colossal mainframe computers its use was limited to the aerospace and automotive industries. As hardware became increasingly powerful in terms of memory and processing speed, and at the same time less expensive, CAD began to gain a foothold in the design community. However, it was not until affordable desktop computers became available during the late 1980s and early 1990s that CAD systems came into serious use in design offices. Albeit fairly primitive compared to today's CAD software programs, these early systems helped to revolutionize design practice in that they dramatically reduced the time from initial concept to working prototype, especially when combined with Computer-Aided Manufacture (CAM) programs. This made the design process more time- and cost-efficient, and enabled manufacturers to get new designs to market more quickly. CAD/CAM programs also helped to ensure better standardization of components while permitting greater flexibility in the manufacturing process, enabling lower-volume and customized, batch-type production, too. The rise of the personal computer, and specifically the Apple Mac, also spurred a momentous shift to digital in graphic design. Rendering the traditional tools of the graphic design trade - pens, inks, Letrasetalmost obsolete, new software programs such as Adobe Illustrator and QuarkXPress (both launched in 1987) ushered in a new age of desktop publishing. In the wake of these innovations, a New Wave of Postmodern graphic design swept across Holland and America. New Wave10 graphic design subverted the holy grid of Swiss School Modernism and playfully incorporated eclectic references to art, photography, film, advertising and iconic graphic designs from the past - another example of Postmodern sampling and mixing. New Wave designers such as Jan van Toorn and April Greiman replaced Modern objectivity with a Postmodern subjectivity, evoking responses in viewers through an innovative variety of visual poetry. Inspired by emergent forms of electronic media, Californian New Wave work used deconstructed compositions to give a sense of messages being filtered through layers, which in turn created a strongly three-dimensional quality and visual depth. Using Apple Macintosh software, designers created a language of hybrid imagery with encoded messages, which was intended to hook the viewer with its quirky image-making and then reel them in as they tried to decipher the meaning behind the work. The seemingly random placement of images, as in collage, also lent their work a refreshing vitality. In 1982 Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko launched a large-format graphic magazine, Emigre, which disseminated the ideas behind this new movement in graphic design to a much wider international audience. Postmodernism eventually came to mean a multiplicity of graphic styles, frequently appropriated, that were typified by visually arresting, layered compositions, often with indecipherable meanings. During the 1980s the increasing emphasis on image over content also led to the meteoric rise of the brand, which with help from graphic designers and product designers transcended national tastes to become a global seal of approval. Companies such as Levi's and Nike were quick to understand that cutting-edge graphic design could give their products a competitive advantage, while other companies such as Driade and Kartell understood the benefit of using brand-name designers such as Starck to create their products. At a time when traditional institutions, from the nuclear family to organized religion, were coming unstuck, branded design offered the consumer a sense of belonging without commitment and helped them to define their self-image. As a stamp of design authenticity and a means of acquiring identity through possession, the brand was the logical outcome of Postmodernism: consumers were now essentially paying for the designed projection of corporate values and lifestyle associations rather than the goods themselves."

        "chapter_test": "The rise of global design superstardom As the Berlin Wall was dismantled piece by piece by euphoric crowds of demonstrators in 1989, a new world order began to take shape. The collapse of this bleak, concrete, barbed-wire-topped structure, which had physically as well as symbolically separated the capitalist West from the Soviet East, marked a dramatic thawing of the Cold War and its ever-present nuclear threat. In the shadow of this momentous event, other nations across Eastern Europe that had been part of the Soviet Bloc for decades also began to regain their independence, through wave upon wave of public uprisings. While the Soviet Union crumbled state by state, a new feeling of internationalism was born; no longer were vast areas of Europe out of bounds depending on whether you came from the East or the West. In the year that the Berlin Wall fell, the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee -who was working at CERN, the particle-physics lab in Geneva - began a project with his colleague Robert Cailliau that would have a similarly transformative effect, making the world an altogether more interconnected place. He created a new computer language - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - that enabled documents to be communicated over the Internet, which was then just beginning to emerge as a commercial service, having first been developed as a network of supercomputer networks based in government-research and educational organizations. Berners-Lee's hypertext system allowed different operating systems to run across the Internet, which gave rise to the World Wide Web. The full implications of this development would not be felt for several years, but when they were, the impact on society- and indeed design practice - was as great as that of Johannes Gutenberg's printing press in the fifteenth century- or arguably even greater. Meanwhile, the adoption of free-market economic policies around the world made for an increasingly global economy, in which design played an ever-larger part. Manufacturers in industrialized countries began to recognize and increasingly to implement design as an important part of their business strategies. Even the People's Republic of China had begun to adopt freemarket reforms in the late 1970s, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who pragmatically noted, \"It doesn't matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice.\" 1 While China geared up industrially, companies in the West came to realize that innovative design could help them to capture the attention of international audiences and carve out market share. The designs produced by large international companies - from personal electronics to kitchen equipment to trainers and cars - were at this time beginning to forge a global material culture in which traditional national characteristics had all but disappeared and leading designers were ever more nomadic. The British designer Michael Young, for instance, moved from London to Brussels to Reykjavik to Hong Kong during this period, working for companies all over the world. Similarly, art and design colleges in the United Kingdom and elsewhere were beginning to accept greater numbers of foreign students, which meant that the pool of talent they were selecting from was much more diverse. This accelerated the cross-pollination of ideas and, simultaneously, led to the creation of increasingly specialized centres of excellence. A still greater stimulus for the exchange of ideas, including those pertaining to design, was provided by the Internet, which fulfilled Marshall McLuhan's vision from the 1960s of the world as a \"global village\". Expanded in 1994 to include more users outside of government and academic networks, the Internet went from having 16 million users in December 1995 - the first year of significant uptake - to 361 million users five years later; the number grew to some 2 billion by the turn of the millennium,2 and today 2.8 billion people - around 38.8 per cent of the global population - are connected to the Web, and the number continues to grow. The Internet facilitated the promotion of design on a number of!evels: it allowed companies to market their designs to a global audience easily, cheaply and effectively, and it allowed customers to purchase designs online rather than having to go to a physical store or gallery. Most of all, though, it dissolved time and distance: a design launched in Milan, Tokyo, London or San Francisco, for example, could be viewed around the world in minutes. This democratization of design knowledge made developments in the field more accessible by the general public, and contributed to the interconnectedness of the global design community. The Internet also significantly accelerated the convergence of the creative disciplines, and art, music, fashion and film were soon interwoven in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional design practice, each discipline feeding and being fed by the others. Just prior to this digital revolution, though, in the early 1990s, the profile of contemporary design had enjoyed a significant boost thanks a new crop of highly accomplished, media-savvy designers based in London, who were benefiting from what is best described as the \"Starck Effect\". This handful of youthful creatives, who would become the next generation's international design superstars, included Ron Arad, Jasper Morrison, Ross Lovegrove, Marc Newson and Tom Dixon. Each had a signature approach to problem-solving through design: Arad and Dixon both came out of the Creative Salvage movement, and so approached their work from a hands-on, craft perspective; Newson worked within a space age aesthetic; Lovegrove developed an essentialist, organic design vocabulary; and Morrison's were mindful and recognizable for a pared-down, functionalist methodology. This new generation of Late Modern designers started their careers at exactly the right time and in exactly the right place; they were \"outliers\" in the design world. They were the first generation of designers to really benefit from the computer-design revolution, and as the recession of the early 1990s began to lift, they also enjoyed a huge creative revival in London thanks in part to the formation of the London Institute - later to become the University of the Arts London - in 1988.3 The institute made London the world centre of excellence in design teaching, a position that it still holds to this day. Another important moment in London's development as a major design hub was the opening of the Design Museum - the world's first museum devoted entirely to the promotion and examination of design - in Butler's Wharf in 1989. Arad, Dixon, Lovegrove, Morrison and Newson were at precisely the right stages of their careers to take advantage of the focus on design in London, and soon they were winning commissions to create innovative products for companies around the world. Many of these firms had previously collaborated with Philippe Starck and realized the publicity and commercial benefits of working with high-profile design practitioners. As the stakes of design for industrial production escalated, and large investment at the front end became more and more necessary, many companies came to value these designers for their boundary-pushing work and their distinctive design vocabularies, which ensured that their work stood out in an ever-expanding array of products that often possessed very similar technical and functional attributes. The Apple factor and Smart Design The hothouse design scene in London during the early 1990s was formative for many young talents, among them Jonathan Ive. Some ten years younger than Dixon, Lovegrove and Morrison, Ive belonged to a different generation - Generation X rather than the baby boom -which meant that he was more cognizant of the needs and desires of a generation weaned on MTV. Recalling his time at Newcastle Polytechnic, Ive notes, \"One of the things that was interesting about my time at the school of art and design is that you were in very close proximity to graphic designers, fashion designers and fine art students. That's one of the things that really characterized my time at college and I think it characterizes a lot of the energy and vitality in London, this density of such creative diversity.\" 4 After moving to London, Ive worked at the Tangerine design consultancy and began to absorb London's design mood, which was then defined by a light, transparent aesthetic, thanks to the widespread use of technopolymers and a certain sculptural confidence. Ross Lovegrove was at the forefront of this essentialist movement, and his Basic thermal flask for Alfi (1988-90) typified the approach. Meanwhile, Ive was asked to design a laptop for Apple while still working at Tangerine; in 1992 he moved to Palo Alto to join the company's design department. Following Steve Jobs's return to Apple in 1996, Ive and the team began work on the design for a new computer that was a huge gamble for the troubled company. Barely 18 months later, the revolutionary iMac (1998) was launched; as is now well known, the \"i\" for \"Internet\" meant that this machine was intended more as a portal for web-browsing than as a traditional computing device. Ken Segall, the LA-based ad man who came up with the name, recalls that the \"i\" also stood for \"individuality\" and \"innovation\" - both qualities that this design helped to introduce to personal computing. Steve Jobs's introduction at the launch event summed it up: \"It looks like it's from another planet, a good planet, a planet with better designers\"; 5 for once this was more than mere marketing hype, and Jobs was correct in his assessment that the iMac marked a paradigm shift in computer design. Previously, computer housings had been box-like, in either matt beige or pale grey thermoplastic that became grubby after only a few months of use. In contrast, the sleek yet friendly-looking iMac, with its bright colour combination of gleaming white and translucent \"Bondi Blue\" polycarbonate, had a visual freshness that set it apart from all other personal computers. Ive had taken the language of organic essentialism a step further in this landmark design, in which he also achieved a remarkable level of functional clarity: once unboxed, the computer could be set up and used intuitively. The success of the all-in-one iMac and its famous tagline - \"Chic. Not geek.\" - reversed Apple's decline and expedited the departure of the dull, lifeless box from the computer industry as a whole. Above all, the iMac showed that a little more investment in design and development, and a fraction more in materials and manufacturing, could help manufacturers to create premium products with emotive appeal: once the emotional connection had been forged between an iMac and its user, the latter was far more likely to buy other Apple products, which would proliferate in the following decades, demonstrating that pioneering design and carefully selected materials have the power to transform a company's fortunes. While Apple was revolutionizing the computer market - and later the markets for portable media players and smartphones - with Jonathan Ive at the helm of the design team in Palo Alto, over in New York, the Smart Design consultancy was quietly starting it own revolution in the design ofhomewares, with its Good Grips range for OXO. This extensive collection of kitchen tools, which includes numerous easy-to-use products, from vegetable peelers to dustpans and brushes, was the brainchild of Sam Farber, a veteran of the kitchenware business who had previously founded Copco, who was motivated by a paper written by the home economist Mary Reader for the Journal of the Institute of Home Economics in which she called for the development of \"intergenerational\" kitchen products that could be used by people suffering from arthritis. As Farber's wife Betsey was a sufferer of this condition, this article struck a chord, as he knew from first hand experience how difficult and painful it could be to use a standard peeler with arthritic hands. Farber subsequently tasked Smart Design to create a new range of tools that would be designed not for disability but rather for inclusivity-products that could be used by a wide range of users with varying degrees of physical ability. The Good Grips range, featuring ergonomically contoured elastomer handles, was introduced in 1989 and extended by Smart Design over the 1990s and 2000s to comprise literally hundreds of products. Like Apple's designs, these kitchen items exemplified the criteria of Good Design: both Ive's designs for Apple and Smart Design's work for OXO were guided by the goal of creating the best possible interface between object and user, and while the resulting designs were slightly more expensive than other products on the market, their enhanced user experience more than made up for the additional cost. Buyers of Good Grips designs, as of iMacs, tended to be so impressed by them that they went on to buy other products from the company's range. As a result, both of these firms grew exponentially in comparison to their competitors, offering conclusive proof that Good Design can make good business sense. New Dutch Design While Cool Britannia was enjoying its design preeminence and Apple was making waves globally, another strand of avant-garde design began to emerge in the Netherlands. Holland, like Britain, boasted a number of world-class design-teaching institutions that gained particular attention around the turn of the millennium, including the renowned Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE), among the alumni of which were the pioneers of New Dutch Design. Notable members of this group were Maarten Baas, Tord Boontje, Jurgen Bey, Hella Jongerius, Bertjan Pot and, of course, the movement's enfant terrible, Marcel Wanders. Another factor behind the design revival in the Netherlands was the 1988 launch of the Fonds BKVB (the Fund for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture), which aimed to provide financial support to design students to enable them to establish themselves as independent design entrepreneurs; the initiative was instrumental in the success of two firms that were key to New Dutch Design, Droog and Moooi. The product designer Gijs Bakker and the design historian Renny Ramakers officially established the former in 1993 and the same year showed its first collection -which included Tejo Remy's Chest of Drawers (1991), Rody Graumans's 85 Bulbs chandelier (1993) and Marcel Wanders's Set Up Shades floor light (1989)- at the Milan Furniture Fair. The Dutch word \"droog\" means \"dry\", as in humour, and was chosen by the company's founders as it perfectly described these sober yet quirky designs made from found objects - old drawers, light bulbs and lampshades skilfully reconfigured into eye-catching pieces. Functioning as a curatorial creative agency, Droog pioneered a sombre, minimalistic form of Late Modernism that was utterly at odds with the colourful Neo-Pop gaiety ofmid-198os Postmodernism a la Memphis. Where Memphis's overblown designs had a strong sense of self-parody, Droog's designs functioned more as cultural commentary. They were also far more visually restrained and conceptual, the constructions often remarkable for their simplicity and ingenuity. Droog subsequently licensed the manufacture and marketing of its designs to the Voorburg-based company DMD (Development Manufacturing and Distribution), which mainly executed them as exclusive limited editions. These designs, created by many different creative individuals, communicated, in the words ofDroog itself, \"original ideas [and] clear concepts which have been shaped in a wry, no-nonsense manner\" 6 - in other words, a typically quirky Dutch response to Late Modernism. The archetypal design ofDroog's new direction was Marcel Wanders's lightweight Knotted chair (1996), a remarkable seating design formed ofa cat's-cradle of roped nylon and carbon-fibre, which was hung over a chair-shaped frame and then impregnated with liquid epoxy resin. Once dried, the woven mesh supported itself, appearing to defy the laws of gravity. But it was Moooi, established by Marcel Wanders and Casper Vissers in 2001, that transformed Dutch conceptual design from a thoughtful, experimental movement into an extravagant, theatrical spectacle. The design collective took its name from the Dutch word for \"beauty\", and at first created innovative work very much in the Droog vein, such as Maarten Baas's Smoke furniture collection (2002) and Bertjan Pots's Random Light (2001). Bolstered by its successes and the vast amount of publicity generated by its increasingly outre work, Moooi's output became ever more detached from functionality; perhaps its greatest design folly was the life-size Horse Floor Lamp designed by the all-female Swedish design group Front in 2006. This type of attention-grabbing design, though playfully subversive, relied heavily on gimmickry, much like Pop Design had done in the late 1960s and early 197os-though where Pop Design had been inexpensive and expendable, this new work was exclusive and pricey, and although design based on one-liner jokes might have been acceptable during the ecologically naive Pop era, it was a slightly different matter during a period of growing environmental concerns. This type of work might in many ways be seen as a manifestation of the vacuous celebrity culture of the 1990s and 2000s, which aimed to attract attention with superficial glamour. The buoyancy of the international economy from 1994 to 2007 made such designs viable, and the boutique hotel phenomenon created a ready market for such work, which could be placed in a relatively plain setting to make a bold designer statement. Design follows fashion, and Design Art The giddy years of financial growth experienced in the 1990s and up to 2007 - fuelled by the dot-corn bubble, by ever-growing levels of governmental and personal debt and by the extraordinary risks taken by investment bankers - were a truly glittering era for design, in which it became a cultural phenomenon across the developed world. This period of sustained economic growth, interrupted only by the dot-corn hiccup of the early 2000s, also coincided, as we have already seen, with the dramatic rise of the Internet, which accelerated the transmission of design information and widened its boundaries. As the world become ever more connected, the dominance of designers based in London and Amsterdam dissipated somewhat, and talents such as Naoto Fukasawa and Tokujin Yoshioka from Japan, Fernando and Humberto Campana from Brazil and Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec from France joined the rarefied ranks of international design superstardom. While Fukasawa took a characteristically Japanese essentialist approach, especially with his designs for the no-logo company Muji, Yoshioka built on the poetic legacy of Shiro Kurarnata to create works with a Zen refinement. In contrast, the Campana brothers took a far more hands-on, design povera approach, using scraps of material, off-cuts of wood, found toys, cheap plastic tubing and readily available aluminium wire to create innovative and imaginative designs, which despite their considerable price tags took inspiration from the rnakedo-and-rnend philosophy found in Brazil's favelas. The Gallic Bouroullec brothers similarly made poetic rather than purely functional work, such as their Algue screening system made of clipped-together plastic branches that resembled seaweed - a design that shared the lyrical qualities of the exclusive movement that later became known as \"Design Art\", but which was actually mass-produced on a large scale: Vitra sold over 3 million Algue units between 2005 and 2009. 7 By the early 2000s avant-garde design was for the most part no longer dictated by function, but rather by the whims of fashion. In 2001 a journalist for The New York Times, Julie Iovine, interviewed the architect John Pawson at the Milan Furniture Fair; during the interview Pawson noted that \"designers and architects have a lot to learn from fashion ... They shouldn't be so blinkered. Haven't they cottoned on that things have changed? It isn't just about making designs to last a thousand years.\" 8 Some designers and manufacturers had already cottoned on, and, encouraged by a vigorous economy, were beginning to create seasonal collections rather than definitive design solutions - it is interesting to note that Claudio Luti, the CEO and owner of the Italian manufacturing company Kartell, who made it the major global brand it is today, was the managing director of the Gianni Versace fashion house before taking up the reins at Kartell in 1988. And \"design as fashion\" was not only a facet of the Milan Furniture Fair, with its avant-garde exhibits; rather, fashionability was also increasingly important in mainstream design, especially that of electronic products such as mobile phones, which were constantly being rendered functionally obsolete thanks to the rapidity of technological innovation. Also in the mass market, many products -whether kettles and washing machines or laptops and sofas - were virtually indistinguishable from each other in terms of price and functionality, so appearance was often the only way a manufacturer, and indeed the consumer, could distinguish between products. Being \"on trend\" came to be increasingly important for sales - and of course those trends were often determined by fashion forecasters, who were now increasingly being called upon by manufacturers of goods that were not previously so influenced by the vagaries of fashion. Given the growing transience of objects, it is perhaps unsurprising that there was also a huge revival of interest in \"design classics\" during this period, and companies such as Vitra and Fritz Hansen began to reintroduce older iconic designs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, the names of Charles and Ray Eames had been virtually unknown to everyone but a handful of avid design collectors, but in the space of two decades their work had been rediscovered by another generation and was more popular than ever. It appeared everywhere, from beer advertisements to various branches of McDonald's restaurants. While the design classics of the past went mainstream, a certain sector of contemporary avant-garde design moved decisively upmarket, into the curious netherworld of Design Art. Functioning in much the same way as haute couture does in the fashion world, Design Art was unashamedly elitist, yet it was also where a handful of gifted designers and architects - notably Ron Arad, Marc Newson, Ross Lovegrove, Zaha Hadid and the Campana Brothers - could pursue a new creative freedom unrestrained by economic concerns; the results would be some of the most beautiful and poetic designs ever made. As markets became more globalized and mainstream design tended towards ever-greater universalism, Design Art countered the trend by creating bespoke, individual designs, which were supported financially by the emerging demographic of the super-rich - an unprecedented elite who could afford the luxury of such pieces. The flourishing oflimited-edition Design Art was fed during the early 2000s by auction houses, design fairs and galleries, which introduced these pieces into the feeding frenzy of the day in the contemporary fine art market. The term \"Design Art\" is, in fact, credited to Alexander Payne, the worldwide director of design at the auctioneer and art dealership Phillips de Pury & Company, who organized the sale-room's first of many Design Art sales in 2001. By enabling a small group of designers to explore new forms, materials and technologies, the movement brought architectural and artistic concepts into design, and in so doing provoked discussion about the role of function in design and our interaction with designed objects and environments. Because such designs were produced in very small numbers, they had minimal environmental impact; as collectors' pieces they also had, like works of fine art and very much unlike most mainstream design of the time, an inherent longevity. While the Campana brothers created Design Art pieces using found objects and traditional production methods, other Design Artists preferred a more high-tech approach, and Ron Arad's bronze MT rocker (2005), Zaha Hadid's Vortexx light (2005), Marc Newson's Voronoi Shelf unit (2007) and Ross Lovegrove's Gingko table (2007) were all developed using state-of-the-art computer-aided design (CAD) software. Being produced using the same CAD software packages, these designs actually shared a similar aesthetic, which sometimes made it difficult to distinguish the work of one designer from another. Nevertheless, the Design Art movement convincingly demonstrated that it was possible to invest limited-edition designs with expressive beauty, and that there was a small but very wealthy coterie of collectors who were prepared to pay a premium price for individuality, and who also saw the investment potential of Design Art. Meanwhile, for all its elitism, Design Art had a trickle-down effect much like that ofhaute couture on mainstream fashion, and these exclusive designs influenced mass-produced goods - for instance, a number of Ron Arad's limited-edition pieces were translated into plastic by Vitra and Moroso and sold for a fraction of the price. 3-D printing, biomimicry and upcycling During the mid 2000s laser stereolithographynow better known as 3-D printing-was still very much in its infancy, but most of the leading design studios and design teaching establishments made the considerable investment to have this new technology at their disposal. These early machines essentially grew prototypes in layers from vats ofliquid photopolymer resin that is cured using ultra-violet beams oflight. Enabling designers to give substance to their dreams within a matter of hours, they radically reduce the prototyping stage of the design process and allow greater exploration offirst-stage design concepts thanks to the ease and low cost of model-making. Around the time that 3-D printing was making inroads into design practice, a new theme in design was also beginning to gain considerable ground: biomimicry, the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries' answer to nineteenth-century \"design botany\" as pioneered by Christopher Dresser. Although the term biomimicry was coined in the early 1980s, it wasn't in widespread use in the design world until the publication of Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature in 1997, by the biologist Janine Benyus. Biomimicry is a science related to design, which takes nature as its model, measure and mentor. By learning from nature and its evolutionary adaptations, it is argued that we will be able to create design solutions that are better suited to the human condition and also more ecologically sustainable. By translating the laws governing biological systems into a framework that can be applied to the practice of design, we should be able to enhance the natural logic of our products: for instance, at the time of writing algorithms based on swarm theory- the actions of ant or bee colonies - are being used to develop artificial-intelligence systems, while studies of insects are being used in the design of miniaturized robotic drones, know as flybots. The possible ramifications of such developments are disconcerting, and as technologies advance this moral dilemma will doubtless be faced more frequently; just because something is possible to make doesn't necessarily mean it should be made. On a brighter note, though, biomimicry might offer design solutions to all sorts of ecological problems, from the development of sustainable water schemes to the construction of buildings that store carbon emissions. Another book that fundamentally altered the design community's approach to the environment was Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things, published in 2002. Its authors, William McDonough and Michael Braungart, highlighted the waste and destruction wrought when consumer products are made, used and then discarded; they charted the effects at all stages of the process, from the toxic dyes used to the carcinogenic phthalates that leach from degrading plastics, forcing designers to consider in more depth the life cycle of their products. The book also suggested ways in which to lessen an object's net environmental impact, from sourcing local materials in order to reduce emissions related to transportation or using sustainably harvested woods. Perhaps the most shocking statistic that McDonough and Braungart unearthed was that \"the product itself contains on average only 5 percent of the raw materials involved in the process of making and delivering it.\" 9 More than a decade later, McDonough and Braungart published another book, Upcycle (2013), in which they argue that rather than sustainability, we should design for abundance - that instead of minimizing the ecological footprint of a product, we should instead be trying to maximize the environmental benefits of its design, for example by devising carpets that clean the air or fences that capture solar energy. Although these books offer intriguing glimpses of better ways of designing and making products, the reality is that most goods that are manufactured are far removed from these ideals. In north-east China, the city of Shenyang- like so many of China's industrial hubs - has skies filled with thick smog as factories belch a toxic cocktail, churning out all manner of ephemeral products, from plastic shoes to gimmicky stocking fillers and poorly made kitchen gadgets. All these products and more can be found piled high in the city's vast Wu'ai Market, the largest international trade centre in northern China, which fills a huge complex of linked buildings with floor upon floor of small stalls selling extremely cheap goods, which are bought and exported to the furthest reaches of the globe with scant regard for the environmental destruction caused. This waste can only be prevented by stemming demand, and this will only be achieved through design education. In fact, there is very little difference between the shoddy goods found in Shenyang and those that were displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851, except that the scale of production is now infinitely greater and, as a result, the environmental impact infinitely worse."

        "chapter_test": "SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS Although the economic downturn that began in 2007 has somewhat curbed excessive consumption and helped to focus some designers on satisfying real needs, there still exists a wanton amount of waste; resources are squandered and consumers encouraged to update and replace their possessions with startling frequency. Sustainability is about reusing, reducing and recycling, and can be achieved by making very small changes to our buying habits - not replacing the electronic products we rely on until absolutely necessary, furnishing our homes with antiques or second-hand items and making sure that any new products we do buy are well designed and well made, and so will last longer. In such an environment there is a distinct glimmer of hope for design reform, because when people have access to well-designed products they become more discerning in their purchases, and so Good Design effectively breeds Good Design. Sometimes, though, it is difficult to determine whether a design is really good. Take, for example, the iPhone - a small yet perfectly formed device that is the quintessential design of the present era. Its functional clarity and user-friendly interface are reminiscent of the pioneering work of Dieter Rams for Braun, and its alluring, sleek form is as seductive as any design by Raymond Loewy; then, Apple's frequent upgrading would have trumped even Harley Earl, tarnishing the existing model by introducing a new look and enhanced capability. More than any other design, the iPhone demonstrates the convergence of technologies, elegantly combining a host of functions that only a few years ago would have been served by a variety of separate products, from music players and cameras to compasses and stop-watches - all of which have now been rendered effectively obsolete. The iPhone also encapsulates the other main themes of contemporary design practice, among them universal solutions that can be subject to mass customization, haptic feedback that engenders emotional response and, lastly but by no means least, intuitive interfacing connections. As Charles Eames's so famously noted, \"Eventually 496 everything connects - people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se.\" 10 Jonathan Ive's iPhone, like design throughout history, has been guided by connections: with creating purposeful and meaningful relationships between form and function, materials and technologies, objects and users in order to create products that enhance everyday life. From our cavemen forebears chipping away flakes of flint to create rudimentary stone tools to today's designers harnessing the power of CAD/ CAM to create the latest \"smart\" products, design is a process driven by the belief that a better solution can be found to any given need. Throughout human history, the quality of the connections found in design solutions has determined their success or failure, and they will continue to do so into the future. As for the future of design, new materials and technologies - from superconductive graphene and light-emitting polymeric films to nanotechnology and artificial intelligence - will undoubtedly enable products to become smarter, smaller and more functionally convergent, and \"smart\" designs will eventually be implanted into the body to enhance human capabilities. As and when this happens, design's physicality will decrease, but even in the process of dematerialization the discipline of design will continue to shape society. Design is the means through which the man-made world is moulded, for better or worse - and consumers as well as designers and manufacturers have the power and the responsibility to ensure that progress is for the better. Every man-made product has an impact not only on our lives but also on those offuture generations - environmentally, and also in showing those generations how different the past was, and also, possibly, how familiar it remains. The story of design gives us an insight into our own way oflife, and provides us with a document of how people have lived through history. What, then, will our own design legacy say about us?"
